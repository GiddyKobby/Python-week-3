# âœ… Combine lists + dicts â†’ to store structured data.
# âœ… Read/Write to a file â†’ simulate a database.
# âœ… CRUD â†’ Add, Read, Update (change grade?), Delete (optional â€” try it!)

# This is real CRUD:

# Create â†’ add_student()

# Read â†’ list_students()

# Update â†’ update_student()

# Delete â†’ delete_student()

# Save â†’ save_students() keeps your file up to date.

# ðŸ”‘ CRUD is just about finding the right item â†’ change it or remove it.

# âœ… Loops + conditions = control the flow.

# âœ… remove() deletes from list.

# âœ… Changing dict values updates the info.
